We will give simple instructions on our hand-off document that we give to the client in addition to the README to make things as easy as possible.

Regardless, the client and their team are aware of how many customers will make database entries, and are ready to expand server space if needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will provide videos on how to use the software from both a developer&#8217;s and a user&#8217;s perspective.

This means that our testing needs to be thorough when finding bugs in our user interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only that, but our tool will be used in the medical field where accuracy is the upmost importance. When considering database entry of information, bugs in the backend are very important to find and fix. Entries need to be accurate, and equally as important they need to be easy to access and manipulate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unit testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>User interface\n<ul>\n<li>Testing our user interface will involve making sure there is a seamless transition from our home page to both the video page and the survey itself.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We will do most of our testing on the survey portion of the app. This means testing a tree of different paths in the survey, for example, filling out the entire survey and attempting to re-pick answers, refreshing the page during survey usage, and selecting different combinations of answers. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>We will also test the home page to make sure that going forwards and backwards in the browser works as intended, in this case allowing our users to do so with warning that their answers will not be saved if they move back in the browser from the survey page. Video tutorial progress will also not be saved. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lastly, we will test the dashboard of our application, that is, the interface that faces the medical professionals looking at data. This is not of the upmost importance to our project as a whole for the semester, so this is something that we may not get to given our timeline.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This portion of our testing will not use automated testing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>With more time and resources, testing on a control group of patients would yield the best results. We could then see exactly what these people like or don&#8217;t like about our app and make changes based on that, but we do not have the time or resources to do this. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Backend testing\n<ul>\n<li>Create correctly formatted JSON objects before sending said objects to the database.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Database logs are correctly formatted in the database after being sent. POST and GET requests return all values that are expected in the right order and format. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>A get request sent to the dashboard is correctly formatted in the given placeholders that the front end uses for display.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>With all the time in the world, we would create very strict and exhaustive testing, but for the time being, the tests will be relatively simple, but rigorous enough that we are confident handing off our app. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Integration and System Testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Test the recording of correct survey responses from the front end, formatting into a JSON object, and logging to the database using POST. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Test separately a GET request, and that it correctly returns expected values.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Test that the containerization of our app works as expected, that one link leads in and out of the survey, and a unique token is generated when a new link is created that is tied to the expected recipient. This is something that may or may not be tested in our timeline as it is a reach goal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Description of tools</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We will use a combination of Jest for assertions and javascript functions to automate what is described above apart from the UI testing as that will be manual. Some of our integration testing will be manual as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>End users</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our users will be patients with hematologic malignancies at UNC Hospitals. This is important as most of the patients are older in age, and want their medical experience to be as easy as possible as they spend a lot of time receiving care. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Acceptance testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We plan to hold a meeting towards the end of the semester with our client to go through our testing process, and see if this meets their expectations that they set out for us originally. </li>\n</ul>\n",

Leukemia is a life-threatening form of cancer that affects a vast number of people, and treatment strategies vary drastically in how they affect each patient. Our project, PRIME, is a survey platform that collects information from patients on their preferences of treatment, such as living longer, minimizing hair loss, being able to move around, and others. This information will help direct doctors into what sort of treatments we should give patients, which can ultimately improve their quality of life and personalization of care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work specifically revolves around us creating a website that works for both patients and doctors. The doctors will be able to add new patients to our database and add them to a list of people who are continually sent surveys once a month. The doctors can use these results to plan appropriate treatments. The patients will receive straightforward directions on how to do the survey and submit it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This work is not only important because leukemia is a very serious disease, but because treatment can vary greatly in side effects and outcomes. The work that we are doing will have a big impact on the lives of leukemia patients, as it will provide doctors with critical information that can help them make informed decisions about their patients&#8217; treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lives and treatment of leukemia patients should be heavily affected in a positive way by the website we are creating for Dr. Richardson. By providing Dr. Richardson with valuable insights into his patients&#8217; priorities, we are helping to curate a treatment plan that caters itself to the specific values which the patients personally value. This is a project we wholly believe in and we believe that our work will make a real difference in the lives of those who are battling leukemia. Fighting leukemia is one of the most difficult things a person can do, so any opportunity to smoothen the process out is one we are happy to jump on.</p>\n",

These include false information, selling of information, and increased societal pressures. The primary ethical dilemma we discussed was with how Facebook collects user information and sells it to other companies. This seems unethical because your information and habits shouldn’t be collected by an application and sold at the expense of  your privacy. The reason people use the app is for social connections not to have private information stolen. This is a problem caused by the software engineers making the app collect this data. There is definitely a need to collect some information, but it’s too extensive. There is also the issue of how the software is being used which is when the people who have access to the data including personal information are selling it to other companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Targets Customer Information Storage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Target and many other companies&#8217; storage methods of customer information, specifically credit card information can be unethical. While many companies store credit card information to track individuals purchases it’s still unethical because it exposes them to having that data leaked by the company&#8217;s system. Target was hacked a while back and many of its previous customers had to go out and get new credit cards because of Target storing that information. This is a problem with storage features within Target software and how well it protects important information. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple AirTags</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple created a product known as AirTags to help consumers keep track of important things including luggage, keys, and many other things. By checking the app on your phone it can track a bluetooth signal the tag is sending out. We thought this could be unethical because these tags can easily be misused. Recently a woman is suing Apple because a man put an AirTag under her car’s bumper so he could stalk her. This is a problem with the feature of the software product which can easily be used for things other than its original intentions. There is also no easy way to ensure that AirTags are not misused to stalk or track other people and their things. The product behavior is too powerful for it to be easily accessible to anyone who can buy it when it has so many possibilities for misuse.</p>\n",

I lead a research group involving PhD students, medical fellows, and medical students. Our research group has developed a prototype electronic patient-facing values clarification tool for older adults with leukemia called “PRIME” (Preference Reporting to Improve Management and Experience) using Adobe XD. We used a participatory co-design process involving patients, caregivers, and clinicians to develop PRIME. Our formational studies demonstrate that patients and clinicians find PRIME acceptable, and that it may be effective at improving treatment decisions. PRIME uses best-worst scaling (BWS), a simple yet robust values clarification method, to capture patient values. We engaged over 800 patients, caregivers, and oncologists to create and refine a blood cancer specific BWS measure that is used in PRIME. Our goal is that PRIME would generate a personalized values dashboard in real-time to inform shared decision-making between oncologists and patients about chemotherapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, survival is tragically short for most patients with leukemia. It is critical that decisions about chemotherapy are aligned to patient preferences. Choosing the “best” treatment option often depends on what each patient values most: quality of life or living longer. Patients with leukemia differ substantially in their preference for prioritizing these outcomes. Therefore, accurately clarifying patient values is essential to inform treatment decisions and limit unnecessary suffering. This currently is done very poorly as patients and oncologists often do not have the tools to adequately discuss patient preferences and incorporate them into treatment decisions. Currently, no tools have been developed to assist in this process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The objective of this proposal is to build upon our current prototype to develop a mHealth application that is able to deliver the BWS measure (and other surveys) to patients and to produce real-time visualizations of their results. We plan to use this tool as part of a randomized clinical trial to improve treatment decision-making among older patients with leukemia. This tool needs to have the following functionality:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Deliver the BWS measure (similar to a survey) to patients electronically along with other patient-reported outcome measures (electronic consent would be ideal)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Analyze the results of the BWS measure in real-time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generate a personalized visualization of the results of the BWS (see examples in attached PDFs) for patients including longitudinal results if they have taken the BWS measure more than once.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Send results of the BWS survey to the treating oncologist.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be HIPPA compliant / secure</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Other non-essential functionality would include: &#8211; Incorporate educational videos for patients to orient them to the tool and the study</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Interact with existing electronic health record systems (EPIC, UNC MyChart)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Securely store all data for all participants</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incorporate the functionality/usability of our current prototype</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We envision either a web-based platform or an app, either would be appropriate.</p>\n",
