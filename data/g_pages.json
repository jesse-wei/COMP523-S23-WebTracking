Volumetric Capture aims to turn the scanned human video into a 3D model. Team G is taking charge of building up the website application and model pipeline for the users to implement the model with the easiest interaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>User Documentation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our technology could be implemented in different fields, such as medical models and film production. The potential users are mostly experts in different fields, but they are not expected to understand the structure of the website. The users could access the following functionalities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sign up, log in, and log out\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Users are required to create an account to build up the project and download the model. Projects and uploaded files are saved in users’ personal accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manage project\n<ul>\n<li>After logging into the account, the users could manage their projects from their own main page. Users are able to create a new project, edit a project and delete a project by clicking the corresponding buttons on the main page. Projects are displayed as cards on the main page. Users could edit project descriptions, upload images, and adjust the parameter for the model when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upload files and Insert parameter\n<ul>\n<li>Images are input for the model.

The mission of UNC Blue Sky Innovations is to improve storytelling and education through technological innovations. The team aims to use technology to enhance human beings’ lives. Their projects include Artificial Intelligence, augmented virtual reality, and robots. So far, the research lab implemented its AR technologies in real life, such as engaging hospital patients in physical activities and immersive speed climbing for athletes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bhargav Bompalli is currently working on volumetric capture at Blue Sky Innovations. The volumetric capture project uses deep learning models to process and manipulate videos of humans captured by cameras to create 3D models of humans. Three different machine learning models are used for this process, but our client must manually run each step one at a time, as well as manipulate the data so that the machine learning models produce the correct output. This provides an opening for human error and slows down the creation of the 3D model. The strict inputs required for these models and usage of the command line to run them makes the process difficult for those without programming experience. Our client has tasked us with creating software to automate this process that can be interacted with through a simple user interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology merged the real-world environment and generated 3D models together, and this would be very likely how people interact with each other in the future. Volumetric capture could be applied in different fields, such as the medical, education, and entertainment industry. For instance, the biology professor could present a 3D body model in the class to bring students a better view of the human skeleton and organs. Even more, Sci-Fi directors could implement this technology into their film production. In the UNC community, we could use this technology in-class activities to give students a more interactive and immersive educational environment. Our target user group is large, and it could influence more people and give more surprising outcomes in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this project, we can apply what we learned from school to real-world problems. We also practiced important communication skills as a group. We also learned that it is essential to consider the accessibility of technology for all users, including those without programming experience. So, We practiced how to make specific project documentation for users and future developers. Since our project is built based on several open-sourced projects, we also learned how to find and then use open-sourced packages and experienced the benefits of the open-source community and how we can contribute to it by sharing our code and knowledge with others. Furthermore, this project allows us to contribute to society by implementing technology that can enhance education, medical care, and entertainment. We may also make this project free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose if possible to give back to the open-source community to make it stronger.&nbsp;</p>\n",

The Therac-25 made use of concurrent programming to compute the radiation doses for its patients. However, there were race conditions that existed within the code that sometimes caused patients to receive doses up to hundreds of times greater than normal. These concurrent programming errors would result in death or serious injury, with at least six known accidents occurring between 1985 and 1987.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software which seriously injures or even kills its users is clearly unethical, but this issue stems from the lack of proper unit tests for the software. Software that physically interacts with humans should be thoroughly tested, especially if failure could lead to the death of a user. This problem lies mostly with the software engineers involved for overestimating the robustness of their code, or with the project manager for allowing the software to be used on people without thorough testing. Besides injuring its users, the Therac-25 software is also unethical because it diminished the trust people have for computer-controlled machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Biased Face AI &#8211; </strong> <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90354348/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-congress-face-recognition-hearing-ai-bias\">Source</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Facial recognition systems trained and tuned to identify white males might return false positives or misidentify persons of color. According to a hearing at the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Buolamwini from MIT said AI face recognition algorithms were only mainly effective on white men. Buolamwini’s research at MIT also showed that Amazon’s face software Rekognition has particular difficulty identifying women and people of color. This could result in someone being unfairly labeled a criminal for life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many possible causes of biased face recognition. One possibility is that data with biased labels were used in training. Another possible reason is that the majority of the algorithm developers are white men. As AI plays a more and more important part in decision making, such bias can increase the inequality of gender and race. The social and economical disadvantages these inequalities bring will be used to train the AI and let the AI become increasingly biased. It is a vicious cycle. So, it is important to put the AI algorithms as well as companies who develop AI under regulation to ensure the AI becomes more neutral. It is also important to let the AI developers have more diverse backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Data Misuse &#8211; </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal\">Source</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, Christopher Wylie revealed that his former company UK political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica acquired and used personal data from Facebook users. The data was originally collected for academic research. Cambridge Analytica misused up to 87 million facebook profiles. The data misuse and privacy issues triggered a series of online movements, such as the #DeleteFacebook trend on twitter. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized for the situation on CNN and decided to shift the company’s initial focus on data portability to locking down data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data misuse is defined as using data in ways it was not intended for. Many technology companies are also accused of data misuse, such as Twitter and Google. Data misuse violates users’ privacy, which would cause legal issues, heavy fines, and a loss of customer trust in the long term. In order to prevent data misuse, the company should build clear data access requests, set up security policies, and implement identity and access management.</p>\n",
