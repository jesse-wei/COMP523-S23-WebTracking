Focus on the first 4 in the first meeting. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the proof of concept, thinking about HIPPA may not be critical, but the final product would need to be (in other words, HIPPA isn&#8217;t something we need to discuss with them early).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We need to discuss when we will deploy the software and how, if it is on our side or their side in the deploying process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Louie&#8217;s final suggestion: play with Trello to keep organized, maintain a Kanban Board. Up to us whether we use GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. Linting and GitHooks can also help us keep our code clean.</li>\n</ul>\n",
