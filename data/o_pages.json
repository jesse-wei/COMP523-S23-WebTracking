The application is easy to use and to visualize each post and its details. Users will be able to see these posts and click on each post for additional details of the post, as well as search for a post that is within the database.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Admin Documentation</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentation for setting up the system and maintaining the application will be provided through an easy to follow video tutorial, as well as in the README file within the GitHub repository. The admin, which is our client, will need to know how to clone the repository, as well as run the virtual environment within the backend folder of the project, and install all necessary dependencies. The admin will also be provided database access from Firebase, as well as the Reddit account that is used within creation of the application. The admin will also be provided instructions for using their own Reddit account to create a web application that can be used within the application.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Open a new terminal, go to your directory where you wish to clone the repository and run the command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>git clone https://github.com/COMP523-Team-O/demo.git</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After doing so, you should see the code appear in your IDE environment. Once accessed, open another terminal and make sure you are in the <em>backend </em>directory of the application (for example, if you are in the <em>demo</em> directory, you can go into the <em>backend</em> directory by running this command: <code>cd backend</code>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After going to the <em>backend</em> directory, you will need to run a virtual environment to install all of the dependencies. To do this, you can run the command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <code>python -m venv venv</code> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>inside of the same terminal. To activate this environment, you can run: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>source venv/bin/activate</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>venv/Scripts/activate</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once inside of your virtual environment, run the following command within the same terminal to install all of the dependencies: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>pip install fastapi uvicorn praw nltk</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing all of the dependencies, run the following command to open the backend server:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>uvicorn main:app - - reload</code><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this runs, open up a new terminal within the application directory, and go to the <em>subreddit-app</em> directory: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>cd subreddit-app</code> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are in this directory, run:</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <code>npm install</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>to install all of the packages for the frontend, and then to start the application run:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>npm start</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This will all be listed in the ReadMe file in the GitHub repository</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Access to Database</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like access to the Firebase database, please email arogyadhakal@gmail.com</p>\n",

The goal of our software is to provide a preview and, as our client, a current masters student at UNC and former UNC undergraduate student puts it, a &#8220;pulse&#8221; of the subreddit. By allowing these subreddit users to preview what is currently trending and garnering the most attention, likes, or drama, they can gain a better understanding of how they want to interact with the subreddit and decide whether to browse it at that moment. Moreover, this tool will help moderators get a quick and simple recap, enabling them to create better controls for the subreddit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The importance of this tool lies in the fact that the first level of communication for many UNC students, particularly those who wish to remain anonymous, is the UNC subreddit. Even university applicants use the subreddit to obtain the latest updates about the admissions process. Alumni who graduated decades ago utilize the subreddit to stay current with the University, especially during changing times like a pandemic. Overall, creating a tool that enables all these users to have a better feel for what their subreddit experience could be like, so they can make an informed decision on whether to check the latest posts or not, would empower the approximately 16.2k members of the subreddit.</p>\n",

This was made possible through a quiz app developed by an external researcher who violated facebook’s terms of service. The app harvested user data, including their facebook id, location, and likes, which was then used to create profiles of users and target them with personalized political ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problematic aspect of this situation is the unethical use of personal data without user consent. The software engineers who developed the app were not necessarily responsible for the unethical behavior, but they did create the technical infrastructure that enabled the collection and exploitation of personal data. The unethical behavior was carried out by the company’s executives and their clients who used the software for nefarious purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volkswagen diesel emission scandal</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Volkswagen was caught using software that cheated emissions tests on its diesel engines. The software detected when the car was being tested and adjusted the emissions to meet legal standards, but during normal driving, the emissions were up to 40 times higher than legal limits. The company used this software to market its diesel engines as environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient while ignoring the negative impact on the environment and public health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problematic aspect of this situation is the deliberate deception of consumers and regulators. The software engineers who developed the software were responsible for creating the function that enabled the cheating of emissions tests, but the decision to use the software for deceptive purposes was made by the company’s executives. Both the software engineers and the company’s management were responsible for the unethical behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bias in facial recognition software</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facial recognition software has been shown to have significant biases, particularly against people of color and women. For example, a study by the national institute of standards and technology found that some facial recognition systems misidentified black and asian faces at rates up to 100 times higher than for white faces. This can have serious consequences, such as misidentifying suspects in criminal investigations or denying access to services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problematic aspect of this situation is the perpetuation of bias and discrimination through the use of flawed software. The software engineers who developed the software may not have intentionally created bias, but they were responsible for creating the technical infrastructure that perpetuated it. The problem is with the functions being performed by the software, as the bias is inherent in the algorithms used for facial recognition.</p>\n",

In your terminal, go to your directory where you wish to clone the repository and run the command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>git clone https://github.com/COMP523-Team-O/demo.git</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After doing so, you should see the code appear in your environment. Once accessed, open another terminal and make sure you are in the <em>backend </em>directory of the application. If you are in the <em>demo</em> directory, you can go into the <em>backend</em> directory by doing:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>cd backend</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After going to the <em>backend</em>, you will need to run a virtual environment to install all of the dependencies. To do this, you can run:</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <code>python -m venv venv</code> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>inside of the same terminal. To activate this environment, you can run: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>source venv/bin/activate</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once inside of your virtual environment, run the following command within the same terminal to install all of the dependencies:</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <code>pip install fastapi uvicorn praw nltk</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing all of the dependencies, run the following command to open the backend server:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>uvicorn main:app - - reload</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>After this runs, open up a new terminal within the application directory, and go to the <em>subreddit-app</em> directory:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>cd subreddit-app</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are in this directory, run:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>npm install</code> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>to install all of the packages for the frontend, and then to start the application run: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>npm start</code></p>\n",
