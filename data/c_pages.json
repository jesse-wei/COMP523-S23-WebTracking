The plan for all these users however, will remain the same. A brief <strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TlnVmx_wsE0\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://youtu.be/TlnVmx_wsE0\">video</a></strong> will be provided which will specify basic usage of the app from uploading a file to getting the results that are displayed. This video will goo over running the notebook files to get the results. Any other requirements such as file types and sizes which may be uploaded will also be specified. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Administrator Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Administrators will be provided with a readme document along with the code which will describe the setup process with all the needed dependencies and packages to install, any data needed to be downloaded and general instructions on how to run the program. Information about deployment and the model will also be provided such as what sort of data it was trained on. No logins will be needed for the app currently to allow for future integration such as with mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:43px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Handoff Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A private github repository link will be sent to the client. A link to the notebook file where all necessary dependencies and all the code to produce a result with the model will be provided to the client as well. Instructions to run the code locally will also be provided below which can be done with a flask server, though the client does not require the flask app given that they just require the model. The notebook file is the main requirement with the model and instruction on how to use this are inclueded in our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TlnVmx_wsE0\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://youtu.be/TlnVmx_wsE0\"><strong>video</strong></a>. The notebook files will allow for future development and integration with other platforms such as mobile apps since the code will be easily integratabtle. Based on the current model there are no costs associated with use of the product however the model can be retrained with a better GPU and more data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instructions to run locally on Flask:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Clone repository locally(Github Desktop or ‘git clone’ command can be used)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install dependencies according to the readme document</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run the Flask application by running the command python app.py in the terminal of your code editor after going to the directory with the app file</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access the Flask application. Once the Flask application is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/\">http://localhost:5000</a>. Flask applications typically run on port 5000 by default. You should be able to interact with the Flask application in your web browser.</li>\n</ol>\n",

In specific, we’re constructing a machine learning model that can automatically partition these scans into classes that correspond to bone, brain matter, cerebral spinal fluid, abnormalities, etc. We intend to implement this model into a pre-existing app provided by our client that uses Apple’s augmented reality kit to enable this functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re working with Dr. Andrew Abumoussa of UNC Neurosurgery to address the problem of analyzing the physiology of a patient quickly and in a way that can assist in the diagnostics decisions made when preparing for brain surgeries. Surprisingly, prior work in using augmented reality and/or machine learning to automatically segment parts of the brain is limited, opening up an opportunity to revolutionize patient assessment and brain surgery as a whole. When evaluating trauma to the skull and/or abnormal physiology, medical professionals are under immense pressure to make accurate assessments, especially before or during emergency surgery. Producing a model that interacts with a simple interface than can generate a result within a few clicks is the ultimate goal here, to increase accuracy of patient assessment and, more importantly, reduce risk during surgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this model is focused mainly on its possible applications within neurosurgery, our client’s provided software inter-connects it with other modeling services that can be used in more general diagnostics, even in other medical specialties.</p>\n",

These audio files were free and easily accessible and downloadable. This provided a platform for people to upload audio and music files which were often copyrighted to Napster where others could then download this copyrighted content for free. While Napster was revolutionary in peer to peer file sharing it was also unethical as it allowed for the distribution of copyrighted contents for free where the artist would lose out on their royalties and other payments that they would otherwise get from sales. In the case of Napster, the problem is the core function of the software with the whole software being around the idea of peer to peer sharing audio files. The main function of the software is what enabled Napster to be misused and unethical.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Google Photos</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p> In 2015, Google Photos was created by Google as a website and app to allow users to share and store their photos on the cloud. One feature of Google Photos was that it identified and classified the subjects of different photos like people, animals, plants, etc. for organization and so users could search through their images based on these classifications. One major issue occurred when Google Photos misidentified a picture of a black male as a Gorilla. This was a major ethical issue as the AI algorithm used was involuntarily racist and therefore didn’t allow for equal use of the software. In this case, the problem is one not only by the software’s functions but due to engineer negligence too. The software’s functions were part of the problem as this could be blamed on the AI misclassifying some images which led to this. On the other hand, blame should also be blamed on the engineers who created the AI as they failed to train it to be more inclusive and also failed to test the software enough to avoid such mistakes.

The game was marketed as an indie 2D platformer. However, something was immediately suspicious for some users of the game. When downloading the game, some users reported that their antivirus software flagged one of the game’s executables as a threat. Other users noticed that the game used up massive amounts of CPU and GPU resources, which is uncharacteristic for a 2D platformer game with simple graphics. From this, many people investigated the situation, and discovered that Abstractism was infiltrating the computers of players of the game, and installing cryptocurrency software. This software was being used without the player’s consent, mining Monero coins for the developers of the game using the hardware of the game’s victims. After this was discovered, the game was quickly delisted from Steam, and the developer was banned from the platform. This is unethical due to the lack of consent received by the game’s developers. The fact that the game would be used to mine crypto was not disclosed. Instead, the game hijacked the machines of unwitting players of the game, performing malicious acts without their knowledge. The ethical problem (beyond the questions of energy consumption and other elements of cryptocurrency not unique to this situation) would not exist in a hypothetical scenario where the game developer clearly disclosed that their game would be mining cryptocurrency. Although this would likely make for a significantly less attractive product, this would sidestep the ethical problem here, as the player would have the choice to consent to whether or not their system would be used in this way. Because of this, this is a problem of the software engineer’s behavior, performing malicious actions for their own personal self gain without considering the consent of those that they were preying upon.</p>\n",
