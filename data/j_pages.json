The application is designed to display the locations of edible plants on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. Users can interact with the map, add comments using Google reCAPTCHA for security, and find plant information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technical Overview</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Edible Campus (m)app is built using Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It relies on the Leaflet.js library for map rendering, the Leaflet Routing Machine for navigation, and the ExcelJS library for handling Excel files. The application also uses Google reCAPTCHA to secure the comment submission system and the Mapbox API for map data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application source code is hosted on GitHub at<a href=\"https://github.com/WeiKangda/COMP523EdibleCampus\"> https://github.com/WeiKangda/COMP523EdibleCampus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Set Up and Deployment</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To set up and deploy the Edible Campus (m)app, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Download the project repository from GitHub:<a href=\"https://github.com/WeiKangda/COMP523EdibleCampus\"> https://github.com/WeiKangda/COMP523EdibleCampus</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Run the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>git clone https://github.com/WeiKangda/COMP523EdibleCampus.git</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Install Node.js on your local machine, if you haven&#8217;t already, by following the instructions at<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\"> https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory (COMP523EdibleCampus), and run the following command to install the required dependencies:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>npm install express xlsx multer express-rate-limit axios</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Run the application with the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>node app.js</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Open your browser and navigate to<a href=\"http://localhost:3000/\"> http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Choose a web hosting platform that supports Node.js applications, such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Create an account on the chosen platform and follow their documentation to set up a new project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Deploy the application to the hosting platform by following their specific deployment instructions. This typically involves linking your hosting account to the GitHub repository or uploading the files directly through the platform&#8217;s user interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the instructions in the following documents to deploy to Carolina Cloud:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XMmFrcf3Ee5YmCSd8RQIpVsgkJhG7IFHZEoS0syAM-U/edit\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XMmFrcf3Ee5YmCSd8RQIpVsgkJhG7IFHZEoS0syAM-U/edit</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. Configure the domain name for your application if desired. This step is optional but allows you to use a custom domain name for your application instead of the default domain provided by the hosting platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content Modification</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To modify the content displayed for each garden, navigate to the ./COMP523EdibleCampus/gardenContent directory and modify the Excel sheet called gardenContent.xlsx. Simply modify the corresponding sheet of the gardens to reflect changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add more features of the plant, add the new features in the Excel sheet first. However, in order to show the new features, ./COMP523/COMP523EdibleCampus/public/js/displayGardenContent.js also needs to be modified. We are planning to meet with our client to talk about all the plant features he wants to have and add those features for him. We are also planning to show him how to add new plants and features during our meeting. We will also record a video for our client’s future reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Maintenance and Costs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Node.js application, the Edible Campus (m)app may require occasional updates to its dependencies and security patches. To update the application, modify the relevant files in the project directory and redeploy the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also need to update the garden information and images periodically. To do this, update the relevant data in the Excel file and redeploy the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The costs of running the application will depend on the hosting platform you choose. Review the pricing details for your chosen hosting platform to understand the costs involved, as they may vary based on factors such as bandwidth, storage, and computing resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Support</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you encounter any issues or need assistance with the Edible Campus (m)app, please contact our support team at huhu8@email.unc.edu. We will be happy to help you resolve any issues and ensure the application runs smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Additional Resources</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google reCAPTCHA Documentation:<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQyQVfPCrYbR3sDGgltKUBp_-swKEJ_v8UtO2prn-C4/edit?usp=sharing\"> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQyQVfPCrYbR3sDGgltKUBp_-swKEJ_v8UtO2prn-C4/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reference for Postimage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c7RYiXriPJuYCGJTkClAGQrARLwYR7JMl0Q6SAnYRYs/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c7RYiXriPJuYCGJTkClAGQrARLwYR7JMl0Q6SAnYRYs/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n",

The Edible Campus Program runs several gardens across the UNC&#8217;s campus. Our client wants to build a website that hosts garden information, mainly where the beds are located and what plants are currently growing in those beds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Our project, Edible Campus m(app), will have a lasting impact on the UNC community in several significant ways. By making it easier for students to locate and learn about edible gardens on campus, our application will help to foster a deeper appreciation and understanding of local agriculture. This increased awareness of the campus&#8217;s edible landscapes can spark an interest in the broader subject of sustainable food production, potentially inspiring students to seek further education on the topic or even engage in local agricultural initiatives. Promoting healthier, more sustainable eating habits is another crucial aspect of our project&#8217;s potential impact. By providing information about the nutritional benefits of the plants in the edible gardens, we encourage students to incorporate these locally-sourced foods into their diets. Consuming fresh, locally-grown produce has health benefits for individuals and contributes to a more sustainable food system by reducing the environmental footprint associated with transporting food over long distances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve our goals of increased food awareness, education, and sustainability, we must reach out to the community to make the Edible Campus m(app) readily accessible. Therefore, we will build an interactable website that allows users to access garden information across various devices. With awareness in mind, our aim is to reach as many students as possible to further increase recognition and appreciation for UNC’s Edible Campus Gardens</p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p><strong>Example 1 Developing NLP model by languages with different weights</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using different languages with different linguistic and cultural weights to train language models like ChatGpt raises ethical challenges related to fairness and accuracy. Language models heavily rely on training data to learn and generate responses, and the quality and quantity of the data can significantly impact the model&#8217;s performance. Suppose the training data is biased or unrepresentative of the target audience. In that case, it can lead to long-term systemic biases or failure to capture the nuances of different languages and cultures accurately. For instance, a model trained mainly on data from English-speaking countries may require assistance to produce accurate responses when given inputs in other languages. Additionally, suppose the data used to train the model contains sensitive or confidential information. In that case, concerns about data ownership and usage can arise, which can have severe ethical implications by violating privacy or data protection regulations.<br>Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that language models are trained with diverse and representative datasets that accurately reflect the linguistic and cultural diversity of the target audience. This will enable the model to produce appropriate and culturally sensitive responses and prevent the long-term existence of systemic biases. Additionally, it is important to protect the privacy and prevent bias by obtaining appropriate consent and using anonymous data wherever possible. This will ensure that language models are effective and ethical communication tools that do not unfairly disadvantage certain communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 2 Bias and discrimination with Facial recognition technology</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facial recognition technology has been criticized for its potential bias and discrimination. Studies have shown that this technology has higher error rates for people of color and women, leading to concerns about racial and gender bias. This bias may be caused by several factors, including the quality of training data, the algorithms used, and the contexts in which the technology is used.<br>One reason for bias in facial recognition technology is the lack of diversity in the datasets used to train the algorithms. For instance, if the training data primarily consists of images of white individuals, the algorithm may not accurately recognize the facial features of people with different skin tones or facial structures. This may lead to misidentification, wrongful arrests, and other negative outcomes for people who are already marginalized in society.<br>The potential for bias and discrimination in facial recognition technology is a serious ethical concern as it perpetuates systemic inequalities and causes harm to individuals and communities. Therefore, ensuring that the technology&#8217;s development and use are fair, transparent, and responsible is crucial. This may involve increasing the diversity of training data, developing more accurate algorithms, and implementing regulations to prevent the technology&#8217;s misuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 3 Weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weak cybersecurity and personally identifiable information (PII) protection refer to computer systems and network vulnerabilities that may allow unauthorized individuals to access sensitive data. PII is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as name, address, date of birth, social security number, email address, phone number, or financial information.<br>Weak cybersecurity can lead to data breaches, seriously affecting individuals and organizations. Cybercriminals can use stolen PII for identity theft, fraud, or other illegal activities, causing financial losses and damaging personal and professional reputations. Additionally, weak cybersecurity can result in losing or damaging valuable data, including trade secrets, intellectual property, and confidential information.<br>Protecting PII and maintaining strong cybersecurity measures is crucial for ensuring sensitive information&#8217;s privacy, security, and integrity. This involves implementing technical safeguards such as firewalls, encryption, access, controls, and establishing policies and procedures for data protection and incident response. It is equally important to provide employees with cybersecurity best practices training and to regularly assess and update security measures to stay ahead of constantly evolving threats.</p>\n",

It will help UNC students locate and learn about the edible plants near them.&nbsp;</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Edible campus UNC is an organization that creates landscapes filled with fruits and vegetables with the motivation of bringing awareness to UNC’s vegetation and agriculture. The organization has been able to provide static maps with the locations of different vegetation landscapes, but they never were able to implement a working concurrent interactive map that not only displays the vegetation of the current season but also next season’s vegetation. There also comes the issue of displaying a map that is easily readable and viewable as most of the static maps were only viewable through the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our web-based application, <em>Edible Campus m(app)</em>, has the intention of solving these issues by implementing a working interactive map through a web-based application. This working interactive map allows students and other users to be able to explore the different landscapes and their vegetation around the campus using just their phones. Students and other users are able to locate the nearest edible garden and the vegetation within it anywhere on campus. We think that it is especially important that they are able to view the app while they are commuting so that they may be able to quickly find the nearest garden and try/learn the plants near them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team will create a website that has clickable visualizations representing each edible garden in the UNC campus. Each clickable part will then display different plants within each garden. Each plant will also include clickable parts and links displaying nutritional facts about each plant. The map will can be edited by the admin. This map will be user-friendly, as the admin only needs to change the plants at each garden and the links /educational facts associated with them.</p>\n",
