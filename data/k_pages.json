The purposes of this hand-off document will be to instruct the client on accessing, changing, and using the app and code, as well as providing a description on the technical side of the app’s deployment. The client should come away with administrative or owner-level access to all components of the app and codebase as well as an understanding of how he could direct future developments for the project. Hypothetically, new developers should have the information and access to develop the project further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the development and testing process we may be temporarily using our own accounts for elements such as the Heroku deployment, but we will instruct the client on setting up his own accounts and access to such items. For example, we can transfer ownership of the MongoDB Atlas account used to set up the database or alternatively help him set up an account himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To facilitate the client’s learning, we will have a ReadMe page on the GitHub repository that details instructions on setting up the system, installing all dependencies, and deploying the application. We will provide our contact information (i.e. email, phone number) so that in the event that an issue arises, the client can easily get in contact with any one of us to answer any questions and solve issues. We will also include a section that provides later developers context and information on the app’s codebase and technical stack. This should make a hypothetical take-over process smooth for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The financial side of the app, in the state that we will ideally hand it off to the client, is straightforward. The app’s deployment and database would not require the paid tier of any system we are using. To prevent any large financial expenses from incurring without the client’s knowledge, we shall provide some notes and links to information about the free vs paid tiers of products like Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we will organize a final meeting with our client to showcase the app, its functionality, and the basics of the information on the project set-up and technical side. We will record this video as well as potentially provide a separately-recorded video with more detailed information. These videos will be provided in full to the client via email.</p>\n",

We will focus on making this guide readable and easy to quickly skim. The user documentation may also include specific examples on how to clarify your search and filter results on the home page. We will also include a form of contact for users to be able to reach the administrator with questions, concerns, and suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Administrator Documentation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our admin documentation will be focused on our GitHub ReadMe as well as a PDF document we share with the client and administrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We assume that the admin will know more than the user about the technicalities of the application but not at the level of a developer of the application. We will make sure that the admin can access the code repository and make changes as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our admin documentation we will record demos of the running application in addition to the README resources for the admin that explains how to maintain the system.The documentation will exist as both a written user manual and tutorial videos showing/explaining the more complex features/functionality of the application.</p>\n",

We would create a comprehensive set of unit tests that would cover edge cases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If we had more time, we would also create an option to delete cards using our app’s Edit Form page and thus write tests for the DELETE functionality of our backend.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual Testing\n<ol>\n<li>Given the time frame that we are actually working with, we will be testing the following:\n<ol>\n<li>Testing the RESTful API, including tests for successful GET calls and POST calls, including the case of creating an entirely new activity card and updating an existing activity card.\n<ol>\n<li>Testing the GET calls ensures that we are successfully retrieving information from our database of activity cards on both our Edit Form and Home pages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Testing the POST calls ensures that our Edit Form is able to both make new activity cards and update existing activity cards</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Resources:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bognov.tech/mern-stack-test-nodejs-and-express-with-jest\">https://bognov.tech/mern-stack-test-nodejs-and-express-with-jest</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sazo9/Learn-MERN-stack/blob/master/development/testing.md\">https://github.com/sazo9/Learn-MERN-stack/blob/master/development/testing.md</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Integration and System Testing</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ideal Testing\n<ol>\n<li>Our integration testing will primarily focus on testing the deployed app as a whole, as if we’re future users of the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This approach will hit both of our frontend and backend code, as we’ll be directly interacting in the front end, which in turn will perform all of its project backend API calls.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specifically, we have a number of key features we need to examine on the frontend side:\n<ol>\n<li>Filtering activities by characteristics (activity type, duration)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Searching for activities by name</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expanding an activity for detailed view</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additionally, we’ll be testing all user interfaces on various screen resolutions\n<ol>\n<li>iPhone (multiple versions)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (portrait and landscape)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Android phones</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PC (for the edit form)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We can also potentially write smaller integration tests for events throughout the frontend (e.g. what happens when you click submit on the micromoment activity creation form).\n<ol>\n<li>This would require mocking out much of the functionality of our event handlers, and the testing would be focused on verifying that the correct handlers are called with the correct parameters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>However, this would produce many extra complexities in cases where we need to verify that a new element is rendered into or removed from the DOM as the result of some action.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual Testing\n<ol>\n<li>The majority of the testing listed in part I is very possible and necessary.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We plan to check that all main features work both on local hosting and after we’ve deployed our web app.\n<ol>\n<li>This includes all the features listed previously on all the screen resolutions listed previously.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The only portion we’ll skip will be the event testing. This type of automation would require complex event handler mocking and additional tools for verifying the elements rendered into the DOM, which would expand the scope of our project beyond a realistic time commitment.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Description of Tools Used</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ideal Testing\n<ol>\n<li>Visual Studio Code</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Express and Node.js backend</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MongoDB Atlas Database</li>\n\n\n\n<li>React.js frontend</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ideally we would research and potentially try out both Jest and Mocha to see which is a better fit for our app in terms of a unit testing framework</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual Testing\n<ol>\n<li>Visual Studio Code</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Express and Node.js backend</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MongoDB Atlas Database</li>\n\n\n\n<li>React.js frontend</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jest as our unit testing framework</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Description of Types of End Users</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Teacher\n<ol>\n<li>This is the primary user for our app. Teachers are expected to use our app to pick out Micromoments in class to use with students. They require a user interface that’s easy to search through quickly during class and simple but clear activity descriptions for easy execution.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Project Faculty Coordinator\n<ol>\n<li>This is the other target user of our app. Project faculty coordinators will primarily be using the micromoment editing form to submit new activities and address feedback on existing ones to improve the user experience for teachers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Usability Testing</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ideal Testing\n<ol>\n<li>Given more time for testing, we would ideally have several volunteers test the app while acting as different types of end users. These usability tests would be performed under the supervision of a team member, who would record information about the results of the usability tests and interview the volunteers about their general thoughts after using the web app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For each of the types of end users, we would have a different set of instructions for them to follow as they’re using the app to test its usability. Examples of the ideal usability testing scenarios are below:\n<ol>\n<li>Teacher\n<ol>\n<li>Open the homepage of the app on a mobile device</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search for specific activity by name “_____”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the activity card to see more information</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Start the activity and view the hint</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Close the activity card once the activity timer has completed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the home page, filter the activities by duration of activity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Filter the activities by type “_____”</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Project Faculty Coordinator\n<ol>\n<li>Open the edit form app on a desktop device</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Update an existing activity card (with more specific instructions)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a new activity card (with more specific instructions)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the homepage of the app on a mobile device to view the updated and new activities</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual Testing\n<ol>\n<li>With our current time frame, we will create usability testing plans to be carried out by team members acting as different types of end users. A secondary team member will be present to supervise and record information about the results of the usability tests.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Each type of end user will have a different set of instructions to follow when using the app. Usability test instructions will be similar to the examples written for the ideal testing scenario, with some limitations based on how much functionality we are able to implement by the end of the semester.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance, Reliability, etc. Testing</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ideal Testing\n<ol>\n<li>With enough time, we would set up automated performance and reliability testing for our website.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There are many existing software-based tools for this purpose, such as K6 and JMeter.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Having programmatic performance and reliability tests would be the most comprehensive testing option but also require more time to setup.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual Testing\n<ol>\n<li>Realistically, most of our performance and reliability testing will be done by hand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most of the app’s features aren’t computation-intensive, so setting up automated performance testing would require a large time commitment for relatively little payoff.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For performance testing, we’ll run through most of our main features on various devices and verify that they take less than one second to run. These features include:\n<ol>\n<li>Filtering activities by characteristics (activity type, duration)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Searching for activities by name</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expanding an activity for detailed view</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Opening and submitting the activity edit form.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For reliability testing, we’ll repeatedly check that the website stays online and functional at intervals of several hours after deployment.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Acceptance Testing</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ideal Testing\n<ol>\n<li>In an ideal world with a longer time frame, we would test the app in a classroom setting with our client acting as the “Teacher” end user selecting an activity and using the app to facilitate it among his students.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual Testing\n<ol>\n<li>We will have a Zoom meeting with our client to test and review the functionality of our app and present him with access to all parts of the code and project. To ensure a smooth hand-off of the project, we will make a recording of the meeting for him to review in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
